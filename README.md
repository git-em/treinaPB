# EasyHTK

EasyHTK is an under development Python package aimed to make easier for linguists and speech scientists to train hidden Markov models (HMM) for speech recognition and phonetic alignment using their own spoken corpora.

This project is at initial stage and is currently restricted to training models in Brazilian Portuguese spoken corpora. These corpora must have orthographic transcription available in EAF format (ELAN) or in TextGrid (Praat).
